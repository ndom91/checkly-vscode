# 🦝 Checkly VS Code Extension

Run your local Playwright/Puppeteer E2E tests through your Checkly Account directly from VSCode!

## 🏗️ Usage

You must have a valid Checkly check open in VS Code, with a filename like `*.check.js`. Then you can use either the "Run Current File" button in the bottom status bar in VS Code or the command palette command of the same name.

## 📱 Features

- Adds a "🦝 Run in Checkly" button and command to VSCode
- Will report the adhoc test result directly via a VSCode notification

## 📌 Installation

Search for "Checkly" in your VS Code Extensions sidebar. Alternatively, you can download the `.vsix` file from Github and install it manually.
