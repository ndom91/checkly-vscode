# 🦝 Checkly VS Code Extension

Run your local Playwright/Puppeteer E2E tests through your Checkly Account directly from VS Code!

## 🏗️ Usage

1. You must have a valid Checkly check open in VS Code, with a filename like `*.check.js`
2. There are two ways to initiate a check run:
   a. You can use the "[🦝] Run Current File" button in the bottom status bar in VS Code
   b. The command palette command "[🦝] Run Current File"

## 📱 Features
